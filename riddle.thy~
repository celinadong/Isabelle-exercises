  First prove the following formula, which is valid in classical predicate
  logic, informally with pen and paper. Use case distinctions and/or proof by
  contradiction.

   "If every poor man has a rich father,
   then there is a rich man who has a rich grandfather."

theorem
  "\<forall>x. \<not> rich x \<longrightarrow> rich (father x) \<Longrightarrow>
  \<exists>x. rich (father (father x)) \<and> rich x"

  Now prove the formula in Isabelle using a sequence of rule applications (i.e.
  only using the methods rule, erule and assumption).
